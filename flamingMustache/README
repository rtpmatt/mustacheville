The basic interface with the poofer is a trailer hitch connection. (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EP0G72) wired like this:

 4  /   \  3
 5 | Co  | 2
 6  \   /  1

1-6 will be poofers from left to right and C is your common. To activate a Solenoid you send send 110AC volts to any or all of 1-6.

I've been using sainsmart 8 port relays to do the switching (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0057OC5WK).

Everything else is up to you...
